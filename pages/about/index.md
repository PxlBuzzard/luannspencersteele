# About Me

I am Luann Spencer-Steele; I received my M.Ed. from the University of Missouri and am a Licensed Professional Counselor with the State of Missouri, LPC # 001749.  I worked as a therapist for Aaron Psychology Centers from 1992-2011 and, in 2011, opened my own practice, LSS Counseling, LLC.

My undergraduate degree is also from the University of Missouri, in Education, specializing in teaching individuals with learning disabilities and emotional disabilities. My initial work at Aaron Psychology Centers specialized in counseling people with developmental disabilities. My emphasis evolved into working with individuals who had been victims of physical and/or sexual abuse. As I continued my education, I focused my learning on the issue of trauma counseling. I now work primarily with individuals who are hurting from abuse or negative experiences. In 2019, I completed the three year training in Somatic Experiencing&#174;, which is the life work of Peter Levine and his study of trauma recovery.

Personal information about myself:  I am a wife and mother, who grew up in a Christian home.  I believe we were created to be in relationship. I am on a journey to work on my relationships with others; God, family and friends. I learn from every person I encounter and hope that I am able to provide knowledge and wisdom to those I counsel. I count it a privilege to meet each person.
