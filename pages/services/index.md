Family therapy brings families stability. The family is continuously evolving and growing. As changes occur, families experience stress and feel unstable. In therapy, each family member works to help each other to more fully understand their own uniqueness, bringing the family to a deeper relationship.

Trauma is experienced by most people at some time in their life.  Traumatic events often leave their mark on an individual, if not physically, they leave their mark in the mind and emotions.  Psychotherapy can help to regain self-control into an individual’s life; learning tools to address symptoms and developing coping strategies.

Somatic Experiencing believes in the individual’s ability to recover from overwhelming events. The person finds their ability to restore balance to their physiological, and emotional well-being.

EMDR is an integrative psychotherapy approach for the treatment of trauma. EMDR has standardized protocols that incorporate many different treatment approaches. The goal is to process distressing memories, reduce the effects of those memories, and allow an individual to develop more adaptive coping strategies. EMDR uses a technique called “Bi-lateral stimulation” to enhance an individual’s ability to move through the process.
