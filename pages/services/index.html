                            <p>Trauma is experienced by most people at some time in their life.  Traumatic events often leave their mark on an individual, if not physically, they leave their mark in the mind and emotions.  Psychotherapy can help to regain self-control into an individual’s life; learning tools to address symptoms and developing coping strategies.</p>
